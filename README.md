# Workplace Stress Measurement Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Workplace Stress Measurement Project! This project is aimed at quantifying and understanding workplace stress by analyzing a dataset of stress faces, which is provided by Janith Ukwattage and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janithukwattage/stress-faces-dataset). The primary goal of this project is to identify and differentiate between stress and no-stress pictures, laying the foundation for further stress analysis and prediction.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
The dataset contains images of individuals under different stress levels. The primary focus is to detect variations in facial expressions between two random stress and no-stress pictures. To achieve this, I am processing an extensive number of possibilities by comparing 5,000 pictures from each stress and no-stress folder. This process will generate over 16,000,000 instances (5000 x 5000) that can be used to create a probability distribution graph for deeper insights into stress-related facial expressions.

### Future Goals
As this project progresses, I have several objectives in mind:

- **Machine Learning Model**: I aim to develop a machine learning model that can capture and store each person's facial recognition data. This model will learn and establish a baseline for their normal stress levels and, in the future, make better predictions about the stress levels of each individual at the workplace.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into the following components:

- **Data Processing**: Extensive data processing is underway to compare stress and no-stress images and generate instances for analysis.

- **Analysis and Visualization**: I will create a probability distribution graph to visualize the differences in facial expressions and understand the patterns associated with stress.

- **Machine Learning Development**: In the future, a machine learning model will be developed to capture and learn from the facial recognition data.

## Contribute
I welcome contributions to this project. If you have ideas, suggestions, or would like to collaborate on improving my stress measurement methodology, please feel free to create a pull request or get in touch.

Thank you for your interest and contribution!
